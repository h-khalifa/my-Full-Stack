Exo

online platform for teachers to post thier exams to thier students, students solve these exams and finaly teachers can get statistics about thier exams.

the exam consists of only MCQs and teachers cannot edit these exams after they publish the exam to the students,
each exam has a code the students have to submit that code to start solving the exam.

when students leave the exam for any reason: they can come back and resume solving where they have left.

techers at any time can download excel sheet containing the names of students completed the exam and thier grades.

this project was created using empty web application project but configured to mcv, entity framework and identity were installed to them.

to be added in the future:
-add duration property to the exams so that, the exam is set to be completed automatically by the server in real-time approach after the student take the whole time even if he/she didn't solve all questions.
